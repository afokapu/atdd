"""Convention validator variant `presence/dual_ac_reference` (#1206).

Instantiates the `presence/required_field_presence` template against the composed convention
graph. Traversal execution lands incrementally on the _support graph engine;
this module fixes the variant's contract + legacy parity binding and is runnable
in parallel with legacy validators (imports no persona validator module).
