"""Convention validator variant `resolution/plan_cross_refs` (#1206).

Instantiates the `resolution/artifact_reference_resolution` template against the composed convention
graph. Traversal execution lands incrementally on the _support graph engine;
this module fixes the variant's contract + legacy parity binding and is runnable
in parallel with legacy validators (imports no persona validator module).
